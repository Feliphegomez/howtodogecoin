    An alternate guide for a local wallet and faucets can be found at <a href="http://howtodoge.com/" target="_blank">howtodoge.com</a>. We did not realize we had picked a such similar domain and are very sorry shibes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Anyways, your wallet is where you keep all your Dogecoins. In our guide, you will use a local wallet. This means all the coins are stored in a file on your computer, so if your computer spontaneously explodes, you will lose your coins! However you can and <i>should</i> make backups.
  </p>
  <p>
    An alternative is an online wallet service, but this requires trust because they could turn out to be bad shibes and run off with your coins! Even good shibes running an online wallet can potentially be hacked! Note: you can have multiple wallets like having multiple bank accounts. For example, keep some in an online wallet for convenience and store the rest in secure and backed up local wallets.

    Pick your operating system below to continue with the guide.

      <h2>1. Download your wallet</h2>

      <p>
        First, go to the <a href="http://dogecoin.com/" target="_blank">official site</a> and select the Windows option. Then install and run the wallet!
      </p>

      <p>
        When you first run the program it takes a while to sync. This is because all transactions are saved in something called a <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_chain" target="_blank">block chain</a>. Your wallet must basically download the entire transaction history, so give it some time.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Your receive address</h2>

      <p>
        Now you have a wallet and can start receiving coins! When you select "much receive" you will have a single address. To receive Doge, just have people send to this address. Since it is difficult to type, right click the address and select copy OR select the address then click "copy address" at the bottom. If you were introduced to Doge via a tip, we cover how to collect it with your address on the tipping page.
      </p>
      <img src="images/qt-wallet.png" class="img-responsive pic" alt="receive button example" />

      <p>
        If you want to track your sources of coins more effectively, you can create new addresses and give them labels from "much receive". For example, I can create and give out a new address to receive doge specifically from this guide, which will distinguish them in the history. All these addresses go to the same wallet though.
      </p>

      <p class="alert alert-info">
        Note: it <b>is safe</b> to give this receive address to people you don't know, it is a one way street! Bad shibes cannot pull doge out from it.
      </p>

      <h2>Sending Doge</h2>
      <p>
        There is also a "Pls send" button used for sending doge to addresses you know. Just fill out the fields and send!
