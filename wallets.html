    <h1>Welcome to how to Dogecoin</h1>
    <p>
      The creators of this guide are two newbie shibes. We started mining Dogecoin Jan 14 and found ourselves with 10+ tabs open at a time trying to learn from many different sources. This guide is the knowledge we gained compiled in one place, designed for people who know nothing about Dogecoin other than YES IT IS REAL.
    </p>
    <p>
      This guide was last updated Jan 22, 2014.
    </p>

    <!-------------- new section -------------->
    <h1>What is Dogecoin?</h1>

    <p>
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogecoin" target="_blank">Dogecoin</a> is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency" target="_blank">cryptocurrency</a>, basically digital monies. As described by <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/20/jamaican-bobsled-team-raises-dogecoin-winter-olympics" target="_blank">the Guardian</a>, it is "based on a combination of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin" target="_blank">Bitcoin</a>, the popular digital money, and Doge, the internet meme that superimposes broken English written in Comic Sans onto pictures of Shiba Inu dogs." While the doge meme is silly, Dogecoin is built on the same technologies as Bitcoin and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litecoin" target="_blank">Litecoin</a> and is <b>just as legitimate</b>. Don't be fooled by the comic sans.
    </p>

    <p>
      We've been following cryptocurrencies for a while but Doge is the one that made us jump in. Why? Community and accessibility.
    </p>

    <h3>Community</h3>

    <p>
      The community is very fun and positive. Not very Wall Street. Anyone is welcome, even new shibes (Shiba Inus) like you. There are also many <a href="http://foundation.dogecoin.com/" target="_blank">community efforts</a>, such as the recent $30k worth of Doge donation to the Jamaican Olympic bobsled team. To meet fellow shibes, check out <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/" target="_blank">reddit.com/r/dogecoin</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
    <p>
      It is easy to acquire Doge via tips, faucets, mining, and converting other currencies via exchanges.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mining just requires free software and normal computers, so it is still possible for average shibes like you and me! While 1 Bitcoin is worth ~$800 USD at the time of writing, it is impossible / extremely unprofitable to mine without <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit" target="_blank">specialized hardware</a> that is designed specifically for mining Bitcoin. In contrast, there isn't any hardware designed specifically to mine Doge to compete against! Payouts for cryptocurrencies are also reduced over time as part of their design, so it is hard to mine a currency that has been out for years. Doge was released in December 2013 so it is still young. Such opportunity!
    </p>

    <h1>How to start - wallets and faucets</h1>

    <p>
      An alternate guide for a local wallet and faucets can be found at <a href="http://howtodoge.com/" target="_blank">howtodoge.com</a>. We did not realize we had picked a such similar domain and are very sorry shibes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyways, your wallet is where you keep all your Dogecoins. In our guide, you will use a local wallet. This means all the coins are stored in a file on your computer, so if your computer spontaneously explodes, you will lose your coins! However you can and <i>should</i> make backups. An alternative is an online wallet service, but this requires trust because they could turn out to be bad shibes and run off with your coins! Note: you can have multiple wallets like having multiple bank accounts. For example, store some in an online wallet for convenience and the rest in a secure and backed up local wallet.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Download a local wallet</h2>

    <p>
      First, go to the <a href="http://dogecoin.com/" target="_blank">official site</a> and grab the appropriate wallet for your operating system. "Browser" is for an online wallet, which we will not cover at this time. The download section looks like this:
    </p>
    <img src="images/wallet-list.png" alt="wallet download example" />

    <p>
      When you first run the program it takes a while to sync. This is because all transactions are saved in something called a <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_chain" target="_blank">block chain</a>. Your wallet must basically download the entire transaction history, so give it some time.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Your receive address</h2>

    <p>
      Now you have a wallet and can start receiving coins! When you select "much receive" you will have a single address. To receive doge, just have people send to this address. Since it is difficult to type, you can just copy paste either by right clicking the address to copy or by selecting the address then clicking "copy address" at the bottom. Windows and OSX have the same layout.
    </p>
    <img src="images/qt-wallet.png" alt="receive button example" />

    <p>
      Note: if you were introduced to Doge via a tip, we cover how to collect it with your address in the tipping section.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you want to track your sources of coins, you can create new addresses and give them labels. For example, I can create and give out a new address to receive doge specifically from this guide, which will distinguish them in the history. All these addresses go to the same wallet though.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: it <b>is safe</b> to give this receive address to people you don't know, it is a one way street! Bad shibes cannot pull doge out from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is also a "Pls send" button used for sending doge to addresses you know. Just fill out the fields and send!
    </p>


    <h2>3. Get your first doge from a water bowl</h2>

    <p>
      Ready to get your first doge? There are sites out there known as faucets / water bowls which give you free doge. Faucets are great for poor and new shibes in need of some starter doge or don't have an adequate computer to mine them. These water bowls are filled by rich and generous shibes, so remember to give back when you are an established shibe! If they run out, they are out until some shibe refills them.
    </p>
    <p>
      To receive your free Dogecoin payout, all you have to do is enter your receive address on the faucet site to receive the payment. Much generous!
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: most sites have captchas to ensure you are a fur-real. Also, payouts won't immediately show up. They are added to the block chain, verified, then you must sync up to that point.
    </p>

    <p>
      Below are lists of faucets maintained by other shibes (not us).
